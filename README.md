# Stretch goals    

    [ ] Make reservation identifiers unique across the entire application.
    [ ] Allow the user to create, edit, and delete guests.
    [ ] Allow the user to create, edit, and delete hosts.
    [ ] Display reservations for a guest.
    [ ] Display all reservations for a state, city, or zip code.
    [ ] Implement another set of repositories that store data in JSON format. In this approach, you don't want multiple files for reservations. Consider how you might migrate existing data to the JSON format safely.
